Everything you need to build and manage your beacon project:

- Beacons â€“ secure, reliable and flexible with features and form factor to suit the needs of your project
- BlueCats Web Manager and API to configure, manage and monitor beacons at scale.
- BC Reveal management mobile app available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluecats.bcreveal&hl=en) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bc-reveal/id852676494?mt=8)
Mobile SDKs to power proximity features using your beacons for your mobile apps for iOS or Android.

Choose the right beacon for your project
	- [AA Beacon](https://www.bluecats.com/aa-beacon/) Our most popular beacon. Longest battery life and full Eddystone EID support with dust and weather resistant options.
	- [USB Beacon](https://www.bluecats.com/usb-beacon/). More than a beacon. Scan for beacons nearby and two-way communication between a mobile device and host of BLE via the USB beacon
	- [Coin Beacon](https://www.bluecats.com/coin-beacon/). Compact and powerful. Supports all available Eddystone, iBeacon and BlueCats advertisement specifications with replaceable coin cell battery.
	- [BC010 BLE Module](https://www.bluecats.com/bc010/). The BC010 can be connected directly to a battery or SMT soldered to a host PCB and is ideal for data logging from BlueCats Sensor Boards while the rest of the system is in sleep mode. The module is perfect for application where battery life, small form factor, RF performance and speed to market are important. 
	
	
# Manging Your Beacons 
Bluetooth beacons are simple and cost effective to install and versatile to use for a wide range of proximity-based use cases. This means it is not uncommon to deploy hundreds or even thousands of individual beacons for a beacon project. Once you are tasked with managing more than a couple of beacons, it soon becomes apparent that a robust management platform is essential to keep track of your beacons.

The easiest way to configure, test and update your beacons is with the BlueCats BC Reveal mobile app in tandem with the BlueCats web Manager. This powerful app provides all the features required for field testing and configuration or developer testing of your beacons.

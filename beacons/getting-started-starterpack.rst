Installing Batteries in AA Beacons
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   mounting plate and 2) turning the plate counter-clockwise.

2) The battery bay can be accessed by removing the two Phillips-head
   screws on the back of the beacon and 4) removing the mounting plate.

3) Insert the positive side of the battery into the beacon first. There
   are small imprints within each section of the battery bay to indicate
   the correct battery orientation. |image1|

*Note*: If you are unsure if you have put the mounting plate on
correctly remember that the plate locks into place with a click by
turning clockwise. The mounting plate will be flat against your mounting
surface except for the small indentation for double sided sticky tape.

Powering USB Beacons
''''''''''''''''''''

To feed your USB beacon, simply plug it into any standard USB port! This
includes USB wall adapters or battery powered phone chargers with USB
ports.

What are my beacons doing now?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Your beacons have been pre-configured and once powered, your beacons
will begin advertising in iBeacon mode - no setup required. To find the
iBeacon keys for your beacons or change their values or mode, create a
management account. The default Proximity UUID of BlueCats beacons is:
61687109-905F-4436-91F8-E602F514C96D.

Create Your Management Account
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

|image2| Enter the StarterPack Code contained in your StarterPack into
app.bluecats.com/join/starterpack to establish your management account.
This step will create your first team and site to which all of your
beacons will be initially placed. For more information on the BlueCats
hierarchy, please see this article.

Logging into the Web App and Viewing Your Beacons
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Log into the BlueCatsâ€™ web app via app.bluecats.com with your email or
BlueCats username. A guide to the web app is available here.

Information regarding your beacons is located in the Beacons section of
the web app. Here you can create new versions for your beacons or view
their battery life. |image3|

How does the web app talk to my beacons?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

BlueCats beacons do not send battery life or visit information directly
to the web app. This is collected and posted to the BlueCats Platform by
the BlueCatsSDKs and then is visible in the web app. Apps such as
BlueCats Tour contain the BlueCatsSDK and will collect this information.
BlueCats Reveal does not collect this information or generate visits.

BlueCats Software Development Kits (SDKs)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The BlueCatsSDKs are located on github: Android SDK - SDK Documentation
